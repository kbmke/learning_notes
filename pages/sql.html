      <h2>Database Basics</h2>
      <p>
        A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and
        accessed electronically from a computer system. Databases are used to
        store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of Databases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Relational Databases:</strong> Use tables to represent data
          and relationships between data. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
          and SQLite.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>NoSQL Databases:</strong> Designed for unstructured data and
          can handle large volumes of data. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra,
          and Redis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-Memory Databases:</strong> Store data in memory for faster
          access. Examples include Redis and Memcached.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h3>
      <p>
        A DBMS is software that interacts with the user, applications, and the
        database itself to capture and analyze data. It provides tools for
        defining, creating, querying, updating, and administering databases.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="syntax">
      <h2>SQL Syntax</h2>
      <p>
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing
        and manipulating relational databases. It consists of various commands
        and clauses to perform different operations on the data.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic SQL Commands</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>SELECT:</strong> Retrieves data from one or more tables.
        </li>
        <li><strong>INSERT:</strong> Adds new records to a table.</li>
        <li><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Modifies existing records in a table.</li>
        <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Removes records from a table.</li>
        <li><strong>CREATE:</strong> Creates a new table or database.</li>
        <li><strong>ALTER:</strong> Modifies an existing table structure.</li>
        <li><strong>DROP:</strong> Deletes a table or database.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>SQL Clauses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>WHERE:</strong> Filters records based on specified conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ORDER BY:</strong> Sorts the result set in ascending or
          descending order.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>GROUP BY:</strong> Groups rows that have the same values in
          specified columns into summary rows.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HAVING:</strong> Filters groups based on specified conditions
          (used with GROUP BY).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>JOIN:</strong> Combines rows from two or more tables based on
          a related column between them.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="queries">
      <h2>Queries and Joins</h2>
      <p>
        Queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database. Joins are
        used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column
        between them.
      </p>
      <h3>Types of Joins</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>INNER JOIN:</strong> Returns records that have matching values
          in both tables.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all records
          from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If
          there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right
          table.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all records
          from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If
          there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left
          table.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):</strong> Returns all records
          when there is a match in either left or right table. If there is no
          match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a
          match.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CROSS JOIN:</strong> Returns the Cartesian product of both
          tables, combining each row from the first table with every row from
          the second table.
        </li>
      </ul>
